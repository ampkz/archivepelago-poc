# Archivepelago (Proof of Concept)

Built on React and D3, this is the proof of concept for [archivepelago.org](https://archivepelago.org), a project modeling the transmission of notions of sexuality and gender by mapping networks of 19th and 20th century queer writers and artists. In its current alpha version, it is not connected to the server and hosts the data statically as JSON and CSV files.
